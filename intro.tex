The ecosystem of web applications critically depends on maintaining desirable user-perceived QoE (quality of experience).
% QoE depends critically on web page loading time, 
Yet despite tremendous efforts,
%(\eg cutting tail latency via redundancy or pushing caches closer to end users), 
many users still suffer from suboptimal QoE.
%Unlike previous approaches such as cutting tails of response time or pushing caches closer to end users, 
This proposal introduces a new dimension for web QoE optimization that has been ignored by today's web backend: embracing the {\em inherent heterogeneity} of how much impact backend delay has on the QoE of different users, even if they request the same type of application/service.

%, \ie how sensitive a user's QoE is to the web backend delay.
For instance, a web request that has spent 50ms on wide-area networks tends to be more sensitive to 10ms delay of web backend than a request that has already spent 500ms on the network. 
Such discrepancy in QoE's sensitivity to backend delay has profound implications---
% on how web backend should allocate its limited resources across requests. In essence, 
web requests previously seen as indistinguishable by the backend can now be treated differently in such a way that favors the requests whose QoE is more sensitive to backend delay without hurting other requests' QoE. 
%We show early promising result that by making existing the web backend aware of QoE sensitivity, we could improve both QoE and resource efficiency than existing solutions.
To fully unleash these potentials, we propose to re-architect today's web backend by elevating the sensitivity of QoE to the backend delay as a key factor in the control logic of web backend.

Realizing this vision faces several technical challenges, including balancing QoE and efficiency, estimating the QoE sensitivity, and addressing fairness issues.
We will provide a technical roadmap to quantify the potential improvement (better QoE and resource efficiency) of QoE-driven web backend in the wild and address the key challenges by presenting novel QoE-driven scheduling policies and replica selection policies, and new architectural components that make estimation of QoE sensitivity available in realtime.

% Our key observation is that {\em the impact of a subsystem's performance on a user's perceived QoE varies greatly among users} (modulo web page type, business relationship), so when sharing resources across users, each subsystem should take into account its impact on each user's QoE.

\section{Introduction}

% - QoE is important and our goal is to improve QoE for Web Services.
\noindent 
The fundamental challenge facing large-scale web service providers (\eg Microsoft, Facebook, Google) is how to allocate the backend resources across users to minimize the backend delay in a way that optimizes the user-perceived {\em QoE} (Quality of Experience). 
%Web QoE has been shown to be critically dependent on web page loading time~\cite{??,??}.
Despite substantial efforts~\cite{??,??,??}, maintaining desirable QoE remains a challenge with 50\% users of some popular website spending over 30\% of page loading time on the web backend~\cite{mystery}.
%whose experience could have been improved from bad to good if the backend delay is zero~\cite{dqbarge}.

%Their business models, based on advertisement or subscription, are driven by user engagement, for which QoE is believed to play a vital role (among other factors such as content, user interfaces).

\mypara{Limitation of today's web backend}
Page load time, which we refer to as {\em end-to-end delay}, generally consists of three parts: client-side delay, wide-area network (WANs) delay, and backend delay.
%- Web services, like applications running in the cloud, have been basing their optimizations on the goal of improving server-side latency (sometimes the fraction of users meeting some fixed deadline)
%Because of the federated nature of Internet architecture, web service providers do not have full control over all types of delays.
%---to them, WANs and clients devices are largely blackboxes operated, not by the web services, but by ISPs, cellular carriers, and device vendors.
%(while web browsers and apps are developed by the web service providers, the client-side performance is largely decided by how OS share resources among multiple applications).
With web service providers only controlling the web backend, the performance metric they focus on optimizing is the 
%Thus, instead of optimizing for QoE directly, today's web services focus on reducing the 
%different requests have the same {\em QoE sensitivity to backend delay}
{\em backend delay}, under the assumption that a backend delay of $n$~ms has the {\em same} impact on any request.\footnote{Modulo the content-specific (\eg web page type) or user-specific (\eg free vs. premium subscription) factors.}
% That is, a backend delay of $n$~ms has the same effect on the QoE of any request.
For instance, they minimize the mean/tail backend delay or the fraction of requests whose backend delay exceeds some deadline (\eg 300ms)~\cite{??,??}.
%- This project takes a step back and asks a different question: does the latency have the same impact on user QoE? 
% In doing so, 
%all requests are optimized with the same objective function of backend response time; 
% an implicit assumption is that different requests have the same {\em QoE sensitivity to backend delay} (modulo content-/user-specific factors, such as web page type or subscription type, etc);
% that is, a backend delay of $n$~ms has the same effect on the QoE of different requests.

This proposal takes step back from this assumption, and ask {\em ``does the backend delay really have the same impact on different requests?''}

%- The answer is no, which has profound impact on how web services should be built. [Give a simple example here.] In essence, this means giving each ``priority'', in terms of resources and scheduling, is cost-inefficient and suboptimal. [Give a simple example. resources wasted for users who are screwed already]
\mypara{Our insight} 
Our answer is {\em no}.  More importantly, even if the requests have no application-level differences (\eg web vs. video), such heterogeneous QoE sensitivity can still result from the differences in non-backend delay (\eg wide-area network routing, client-side software)~\cite{timecard,dqbarge}.
%Two observations contribute to this conclusion: the non-linear relationship between page load time and QoE~\cite{??} and the fact that the WAN/client delay varies among requests~\cite{timecard,dqbarge}, {\em the QoE sensitivity to backend delay varies among requests.}
For instance, the QoE of a web request that has spent 50ms on wide-area networks tends to be more sensitive to 10ms backend delay than a request that has already spent 500ms on the network. 

The heterogeneous QoE sensitivity has profound implications for how web backend should allocate the limited resources. 
By falsely assuming requests are equally sensitive to the backend delay, traditional web backend (Figure~\ref{fig:intro-overview}(a)) can waste precious resources (\eg wasting resources to optimize requests insensitive to the backend delay) and have suboptimal QoE (\eg spending inadequate resources on requests critically dependent on the backend delay). 
Instead, the web backend should allocate resources intelligently across requests depending on their QoE sensitivity to the backend. 
In a trace-driven simulation (\S\ref{subsec:example}), we found that such a QoE-driven resource allocation policy can make user engagement 50\% closer to the optimal outcome with zero backend delay than a QoE-agnostic baseline.

%- Research goal: This project proposes that the web service backend should be aware of the QoE sensitivity. This effectively changes how one formulates the web service optimization problem.
\mypara{Research plan}
This proposal introduces ``QoE sensitivity'' as a new dimension for web backend QoE optimization.
Through developing novel algorithms and architectural components, we show that a {\bf QoE-driven web backend} (Figure~\ref{fig:intro-overview}(b)), which is aware of and embraces the differences of QoE sensitivity across requests, can substantially {\em improve the resource/QoE tradeoffs} of web backend; \ie better QoE without using more resources, or saving resources without degrading QoE. 
% Note that being QoE sensitivity does not require expensive infrastructure changes (\eg adding hardware or changing software stack).
We divide the proposed research into four tasks.
%We use the following roadmap to thoroughly examine the benefits and challenges of QoE-sensitivity-aware web service backend.

\begin{packeditemize}
\item{\bf Quantifying potential benefits (Task \#1).}
We will design and carry out measurement studies to quantify the improvements brought by QoE-driven web backend in the wild. We will provide a taxonomy of use cases of QoE-driven control in different aspects of today's web backend. We will also use dataset collected from large-scale web services to understand the opportunities in the real-world traffic patterns.

\item{\bf QoE-driven control algorithms (Task \#2).}
We will develop and build prototype of novel QoE-driven control policies for web backend, including resource allocation, message scheduling, and replica selection. Our design goals are (1) that the policies should balance near-optimal QoE and efficiency (minimal overhead of decision-making), and (2) that their implementation should be amenable to existing systems (\eg only control-plan changes).

\item{\bf QoE-driven backend architecture (Task \#3).}
We will develop new architectural components, including tracing infrastructure and QoE prediction models, to estimate the QoE sensitivity of requests in real-time. In the process, we will investigate the possibility of incremental deployment through reusing the existing tracing and telemetry infrastructure in large-scale web backends as much as possible.

\item{\bf Impact on QoE fairness (Task \#4).}
Finally, we will explore appropriate definitions of fairness to help strike a desirable balance between QoE-driven optimization and QoE fairness. This would also help us recognize potential threads of other systems/users taking advantage of the QoE-driven policies of the backend.

% User-perceived quality of experience (QoE) is one of the driving forces behind the Internet ecosystem, which consists of {\em subsystems}, \eg datacenters, CDNs, cellular carriers, backbone networks, content providers, who share resources across users. 
% % End-to-end Quality of Experience (QoE) is the driving force behind today's Internet application ecosystem, which includes several subsystem
% % The Internet application ecosystem consists of many subsystems, Cloud, ISP, CDNs, etc, and 
% Thus, one fundamental question is {\em how to share resources across users in a way that optimizes their overall QoE?}
% The primary constraint is that these subsystems are {\em federated}: it is impractical to orchestrate a global optimization where they relinquish the control on how their resources are shared. 
% Instead, the conventional wisdom has been that each subsystem shares its resources among users in a way that optimizes the overall performance metrics within its limit and imposes no differentiation between users if they are ``functionally'' identical (\ie same service, business relationship, etc).

% In contrast, we are driven by a simple observation derived directly from the federated nature of the Internet ecosystem.
% In a subsystem, there is {\em a substantial heterogeneity} among its users with respect to how sensitive their QoE is to the performance of the subsystem, even if these users are functionally identical. 
% Thus, the right question to ask is {\em not} how a subsystem should optimize the overall performance among users; instead, it should minimize {\em overall impact on user-perceived QoE}, which requires treating users differently, rather than equally, depending on how much impact it has on the user's perceived QoE.

% In this proposal, we apply this idea to improving QoE of web services.

% QoE matters to everyone!

% \subsection{Missed Opportunities}
% \begin{itemize}

% \item Today's tenant: every user should be treated with the same performance goal. Implicit assumption is that the impact of a subsystem is the same on all users.

% \item However, the federated architecture means:\\
% 1. QoE can be affected by any subsystem\\
% 2. Each subsystem serves users with different QoE sensitivities.

% \item Fundamental mismatch: some users who are less sensitive to the subsystem get over-optimized, while others who are more sensitive to the subsystem get under-optimized.
