\section{Intellectual Merits and Broader Impacts}

%- Intellectual merit: A fundamental view of QoE optimization: taking an end-to-end view. potentially changing the way other internet services should be operated.
\mypara{Intellectual merits}
The proposed research will address interdisciplinary challenges and take an integrative approach to design and implement novel QoE-driven web services along four key thrusts: 
1. Quantifying the potentials of QoE-driven web backend to improve web QoE and backend resource utilization in the wild;
2. Developing QoE-driven control logic for common tasks in web backend systems, including message scheduling and replica selection;
3. Developing new architectural components to make web backend aware of the QoE sensitivity;
4. Exploring the possibilities of QoE-driven optimization negatively affecting fairness.
The key insight is a fundamentally new approach to QoE optimization over the federated Internet architecture, which argues that individual component should not be treated in isolation; instead, they should be made aware of the opportunities naturally inherent in the fact that end-users are affected by multiple components. 
This bears implications not only for web backend, but many other systems too, such as content delivery networks, cloud providers, ISPs, cellular carriers, etc.

%- Broader impact: good for industry. achieving better quality/cost tradeoffs. teaching web services, quality of experience
\mypara{Broader impacts}
The research carried out as part of this proposal will have key implications for academia, industry, and education.


\begin{packeditemize}
\item {\em Research impact:}
The proposed research will result in broad academic.
The PI will publish the results from the proposed research at top tier conferences and journals spanning both systems (e.g., SOSP, OSDI) and networking (e.g., SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNext, IMC).
The PI has strong track record of publishing at these venues.

\item {\em Education:}
The PI will develop new course materials and integrate it into his course offerings in systems and networking. 
% cloud

\item {\em Impact on industry:}
The proposed work has significant implciations for several commercial service providers, including content delivery networks, application developers, and cloud-hosted web service providers.
This work will inform the critical industry evolution by  web service providers to more QoE-driven approaches.

\item {\em Societal impact:}
By delivering dramatic improvement in the experience of users of Internet applications and the efficiency of web service infrastructure, the research will have broader social impact.
