%{\bf \title} \\*[3mm]

%% {\bf Overview:} Each proposal must contain a summary of the proposed project not more than {\bf one page in length}. The Project
%% Summary consists of an overview, a statement on the intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and a statement
%% on the broader impacts of the proposed activity.

%% The overview includes a description of the activity that would result if the proposal were funded and a statement
%% of objectives and methods to be employed.  

%% The Project Summary should be written in the third person, informative to other persons working in
%% the same or related fields, and, insofar as possible, understandable to a scientifically or technically 
%% literate lay reader. It should not be an abstract of the proposal.
%% If the Project Summary contains special characters it may be uploaded as a Supplementary Document.
%% {\bf Project Summaries submitted as a PDF must be formatted with separate headings for the overview, statement on the
%% intellectual merit of the proposed activity, and statement on the broader impacts of the proposed activity}. Failure
%% to include these headings may result in the proposal being returned without review.
%% Additional instructions for preparation of the Project Summary are available in FastLane.\\

%% The Project Description should provide a clear statement of the work to be undertaken and must include:
%% objectives for the period of the proposed work and expected significance; relation to longer-term goals of the PI's
%% project; and relation to the present state of knowledge in the field, to work in progress by the PI under other
%% support and to work in progress elsewhere.

%% The Project Description should outline the general plan of work, including the broad design of activities to be
%% undertaken, and, where appropriate, provide a clear description of experimental methods and procedures.
%% Proposers should address what they want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will
%% know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. The project activities may be
%% based on previously established and/or innovative methods and approaches, but in either case must be well
%% justified. These issues apply to both the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may
%% make broader contributions.

%% The Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a section labeled ``Broader
%% Impacts of the Proposed Work''. This section should provide a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed
%% activities. Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are
%% directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to 
%% the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to the
%% achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full
%% participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and
%% mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public
%% scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in
%% society; development of a diverse,globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between
%% academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United
%% States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

%% Plans for data management and sharing of the products of research, including preservation, documentation, and
%% sharing of data, samples, physical collections, curriculum materials and other related research and education
%% products should be described in the Special Information and Supplementary Documentation section of the
%% proposal (see GPG Chapter II.C.2.j. for additional instructions for preparation of this section).

\section{Introduction}

QoE matters to everyone!

\subsection{Missed Opportunities}
\begin{itemize}

\item Today's tenant: every user should be treated with the same performance goal. Implicit assumption is that the impact of a subsystem is the same on all users.

\item However, the federated architecture means:\\
1. QoE can be affected by any subsystem\\
2. Each subsystem serves users with different QoE sensitivities.

\item Fundamental mismatch: some users who are less sensitive to the subsystem get over-optimized, while others who are more sensitive to the subsystem get under-optimized.

\item New approach: minimize the overall impact on QoE. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{This proposal: Making Cloud QoE-Aware}
\begin{itemize}

\item How the cloud works today -- agnostic to QoE

\item QoE curve

\item Examples of how things can be done differently!

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Research Roadmap:}
\begin{itemize}

\item How much potential benefit does this idea have?

\item How to design a QoE-aware cloud scheduling/resource allocation mechanism?

\item How to propagate QoE information from users to the cloud?

\end{itemize}


\newpage
\section{Quantifying the potential improvement}

\subsection{Background}
\begin{itemize}
\item A canonical architecture of web service
\item What optimizations are needed: resource allocation, scheduling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Categorizing the benefits}
\begin{itemize}

\item Mean performance

\item Cutting tails

\item Resource savings

\item Cheap exploration

\end{itemize}

\subsection{An Example Using Trace-Driven Simulation}
\begin{itemize}

\item The QoE Curve

\item Application (Messaging layer)

\item Synthetic trace generation

\item Results

\end{itemize}
